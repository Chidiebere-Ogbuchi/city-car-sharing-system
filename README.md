Free2move take home assessment 

Task 1: You are provided aggregated rental data per hour for Sharetown spanning two years. The data set is only comprised of the first 19 days of each month.
Your objective is to explore the data, visualize your findings and make recommendations for our management based on conclusions you draw from your data analysis. Please prepare a presentation to share your results.

Task 2: Should we reward users for charging our cars?
Your objective is to:
Simulate battery level of a car over 3 months.
Test different incentives and different battery level thresholds under which the member gets free minutes for charging.
Decide if we should offer our member free minutes for charging and if yes, come up with a good incentive / threshold mix.
What are possible problems / open questions that might arise if we introduce member charging?
Please create a presentation to share your results and share your code as well.

You are provided a dataset with 100k rentals in a given city, a dataset with probabilities that users will charge cars with different incentives, as well as some further parameters below. You can make new assumptions when needed as long as they are consistent with what is provided
